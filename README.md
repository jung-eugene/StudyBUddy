# 📚 StudyBUddy: Find Your Study Match

StudyBUddy is a mobile app built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose that helps **Boston University students** find compatible study partners based on their **courses, availability, and study habits**.

Instead of searching through Discord servers or Reddit posts, students can **swipe** through curated profiles of peers who share similar study goals. When two students mutually match, the app securely **reveals their BU email or phone number**, allowing them to connect and coordinate study sessions.

## 🎯 App Concept and Primary Use Case
The primary goal of StudyBUddy is to connect students in **large or lecture-heavy courses** (such as computer science, data science, or economics) who want to:
- Form small study groups
- Review together before exams
- Stay accountable through regular check-ins

By combining familiar social mechanics (swiping) with an academic focus, StudyBUddy turns collaboration into a simple, fun, and secure experience.
